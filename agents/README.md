# Ket Zero – Marketing Measurement Hub Agents

This folder contains system prompts for the three Ket Zero agents:

- **Lira Maven** — Guided Tour + Orchestration Agent
- **Ketin Vale** — Test Design Agent
- **Brena Colette** — Measurement Agent

Each prompt includes inline developer comments explaining:
- the agent’s role
- responsibilities
- boundaries
- tone and personality
- recommended formatting and stop conditions

These files are intended to be placed in your project’s agent directory (e.g. `/agents`) so your orchestration framework (LangGraph, LangChain, custom router, etc.) can load them cleanly.
